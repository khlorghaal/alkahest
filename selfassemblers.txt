self assemblers

constraint approaches

	cubic modular
		orthonomality friendly to
			data structures and specifications
			human cognition
			rendering
			minecrafters and similar autists
			prior works: von neumann, stevens, cubespawn
		generative algos have little freedom, making fast computation
		most pious
		most expensive and systemically brittle
		strict pow2 sizing
		mandatory crystal uniformity
			best roads and fractalization
		cubic interfaces
			modules fit within crystal boundaries

	prints with insets for mass production blades
		blades of high quality low cost
			pow2 sizes
			attain flexure properties with a configuration function
		most complex topology
		most design freedom
		most error tolerant
			good for realistic applications
		blade anchors must be high rigidity
		manifold interfaces
			arbitrarily adapted to target needs

	subtractive planar
		best for in-situ and random materials
		cheapest
		easiest component fabrication
			friendly to average CNC cutters, lithography
			only 2 long axes
		worst component assembly
			rotation mechanisms needed for out-of-plane positioning
			fastening geometries must facilitate rotational rigidity
				maybe unknown simple universal solution?
		best scaling when adapting to material properties
		portal interfaces
			plane with an extractor
