imagine playing factorio,
but youre incredibly stoned so everything is heiroglyphs,
forms lose shape as geometries become pure symbols

arrangement is a deterministic style function,
and youre doing real programming in a visual language
has homoiconic macros, transpiles to C
discourages arabic numerals and pointednes

keyboard discards all lexical notions
expressions are a vestige of spoken language
temporal nature being used on a 2d raster is bastardized
mathematics must not involve itself with speech

key chords resemble something between a keyboard and guitar
and uses vocal input as modifier keys
